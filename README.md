<p align="left">I have recently picked up a huawei matebook 16 which seems to have an annoying bug on mostly any linux distrubution that the bluetooth module disables itself when the device goes into hibernation/suspend<br><br>I have tested the following solution to be working to write a script to disable and enable the bluetooth module using rfkill<br><br>the following script was tested working on Huawei Matebook 16 running ZorinOS.</p>

<h2 align="left">Solution</h2>

###

<p align="left">run the command which will list the status of the bluetooth module</p>

``
rfkill list
``
  
<p align="left">by disabling and reenabling the bluetooth module, it should come back up again for you to be able to use the module again once the device goes to sleep</p>

``
  rfkill block bluetooth
``
<p align="left">then</p>

``
rfkill unblock bluetooth
``

<p align="left">as I am lazy, there must be a way to automate this wehen the device next goes to sleep which led me down writing a script to automate this process. run the following command which will create our script in an area which will run when the device wakes up</p>

``
sudo nano /usr/lib/systemd/system-sleep/enable-bluetooth..sh
``

<p align="left">and paste in the folloiwng script:</p>

``` 
#!/bin/bash

case "$1" in
    post)
        # This runs after the system resumes from suspension
        echo "Enabling Bluetooth after resume..."
        rfkill block bluetooth
        sleep 3
        rfkill unblock bluetooth
        systemctl start bluetooth
        ;;
esac

``` 

<p align="left">Finally, make the script executable by running</p>

``
sudo chmod +x /usr/lib/systemd/system-sleep/enable-bluetooth.sh
``

<p align="left">Now reviry that the script works by typing</p>

``
sudo systemctl suspend
``
<p align="left">wake the device up and hopefully your bluetooth module should now should wake up when your device wakes up :)</p>
